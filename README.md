### Usage

* Use either Maven or MobileFirst Developer CLI to [build and deploy the available **ResourceAdapter** and **UserLogin** adapters](https://mobilefirstplatform.ibmcloud.com/tutorials/en/foundation/8.0/adapters/creating-adapters/).
* Ensure the sample is registered in the MobileFirst Server by running the command: `mfpdev app register` from a **command-line** window.
* Map the `accessRestricted` scope to the `UserLogin` security check:
    * In the MobileFirst Operations Console, under **Applications** → **APP_NAME** → **Security** → **Map scope elements to security checks.**, add a mapping from `accessRestricted` to `UserLogin`.
    * Alternatively, from the **Command-line**, navigate to the project's root folder and run the command: `mfpdev app push`.
